Social-Media-Sentiment-Analyzer
The Social Media Sentiment Analyzer is a web-based tool built with Streamlit that analyzes public sentiment from posts on platforms like Twitter (X), LinkedIn, Instagram, and Facebook. It uses NLP models such as BERT and TextBlob to classify posts as Positive, Negative, or Neutral. Posts are fetched securely using Selenium-based scraping with cookie authentication, then preprocessed and analyzed in real time. The app provides interactive visualizations, summary reports, and CSV downloads, helping users understand public opinions and trends for brands, topics, or events across multiple social media platforms.
